  This example will create a new guest user with name "rocksse-demo-#" on every
  iteration as long as the stream is running. It will log output to a textarea.

<textarea
  class="uk-textarea log uk-margin-top"
  rows="10"

<p class="notes uk-margin-remove-bottom">
  Note: When the stream is closed from the client it takes some time for the
  server to recognise that the connection was closed and therefore the server
  will keep running the loop for some time. This is due to the
  single-directional nature of SSE.
